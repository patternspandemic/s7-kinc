* s7-kinc

Here you'll find [[https://github.com/Kode/Kinc][Kinc]] bindings for [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/s7/][s7 Scheme]], as well as an s7 Scheme interpreter embedded into a Kinc application meant for interactive development.

** Status

Work in Progress, not usable by others.

  + [ ] Examples

*** Progress of Application

- [-] s7-kinc
  + [X] embed s7 interpreter
  + [X] allow access to the interpreter via a socket server
  + [ ] redirect s7's stderr out to socket clients
  + [ ] organize logging
  + [X] get .so reloads to work.
    Done, but existing objects are still tied to previously loaded c-functions. New c-objects use newly loaded so.
  + [-] Builds
    - [-] release build with stripped dependencies / source
    - [X] development build with shell / load-paths overridden

**** Some Notes
- Prebuilt shared libs for kinc bindings seem to work, but themselves are not linked to needed sds functions. Seems not to be a problem as they're found when loaded into the main application.
