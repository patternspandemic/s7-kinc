* s7-kinc

Here you'll find Kinc bindings for s7 Scheme, as well as an s7 Scheme interpreter embedded into a Kinc application meant for interactive development. It's all a work in progress.

** Some notes

Next up, add to the *load-path*, paths for both s7 bits (cload, etc), as well as the local scheme directory.
Also setup the *cload-directory* in develop mode.
